## Brief description

This is an **automatically generated PR**. 
The following steps are all automatically performed:

- Darwin Core Mapping (DWC) of the target species (*Lithobates catesbeianus*) catches 
- DWC mapping of the bycatch 
- Combination of the resulting dataframes

FYI @DimEvil

Note to the reviewer: the workflow automation is still in a development phase. Please, check the output thoroughly before merging to `main`. In case, improve the *target species* mapping in `dwc_mapping.Rmd`, bycatches in `dwc_mapping_bycatch.Rmd` or the combination in `dwc_joinbycatch_catch.Rmd` which all can be found in  `./script/` or  the GitHub workflows  `dwc-mapping.yaml` in `./.github/workflows`.
